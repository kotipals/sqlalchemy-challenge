# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge we were asked to do a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii. We used weather data which is located under the Resources directory and created plots and other graphs to do the analysis.
We also created a climate app where we created different webpages to display the information that we gathered in the analysis.
